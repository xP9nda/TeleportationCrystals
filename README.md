### TeleportationCrystals

TeleportationCrystals is a customisable paper plugin for 1.19.4 which introduces teleportation crystals to your server.

----

### Usage
Teleportation crystals can be used by players to save a location within an item in their inventory. This item can then be used to warp back to the saved location.
Teleportation crystals will break after a certain number of uses, which you can change.

TeleportationCrystals is currently compatible with [Paper](https://papermc.io/) servers.
